// A common pattern in JavaScript is to execute a function as soon as it is declared:

(function () {
  console.log("Chirp, chirp!");
})();
// This is an anonymous function expression that executes right away, and outputs Chirp, chirp! immediately.
// Note that the function has no name and is not stored in a variable. The two parentheses () at the end of the
// function expression cause it to be immediately executed or invoked. This pattern is known as an immediately invoked function expression or IIFE.
